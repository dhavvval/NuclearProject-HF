# NuclearProject-HF
It is final project for Nuclear physics I (PHZ5305) about Interaction matrix elements and Hartree-Fock. As of now it's collabrative work by D Ajana, J Islam, A Janardhanan, and A Kunjipurayil

for the given repo, we have scripts written in python for Case I-optimizing only binding energy and Case II-optimizing binding energy and single particle energy levels of 16O. Another scripts checks with random initialization of the me2b elements. We also have one script for plotting the figures I, II, and III.
